# kick-init

> Give your new project a kick!


##What it do

Drastically reduce the time it take to spin up a new project. Even with a starter boilerplate the time you spend setting it up for a new project can add up. With kick-init a single command will have your starter project up and running in a matter of minutes.

*When used to full potential kick-init will:*
- clone starter repo into current directory
- delete old .git history
- initialize new git repository
- run `npm install`
- add all files to staging
- create your first commit
- create your remote repo (with `-r` flag)
- add remote repo to local project (with `-r` flag)
- push up all files to new remote repo (with `-r` flag)


## Install

```
$ npm i -g kick-init
```


## CLI

`kick` is the only necessary command to get started. All arguments and flags are optional. The repo defaults to the first one listed in the config file or the default if no config is present. kick-init defaults to not creating a remote repo but can be added with the `-r`flag.

```

$ kick --help

  Usage:
  $ kick [repo][flag]   generate the [repo] starter in the current directory


  Options:
  -c, --clone           specify a repo URL to clone
  -h, --help            print help menu
  -l, --list            list starter repo options
  -r, --remote          create a remote repo for this project
  -v, --version         get current version of kick-init package

  [repo]                specify the repo to clone, defaults to first in list


  Examples
    $ kick -r
    project a with remote repo
    $ kick b
    project b with no remote repo
    $ kick -c https://github.com/davidicus/myboilerplate.git
    will run kick-init with the myboilerplate repo

```

##Config

In order to get the full benefits of kick-init add a .kickconfig.json file to your root directory. There are two sections of the config. The **repos** property will list out all repos available to clone. The second property is **github**. Here you will list your username and personal access token. Check out how to get a personal access token [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/). Without the config file you will not be able to create a remote repo but can still start a local project. Get ta kickin!

```

//.kickconfig.json

  {
    "repos": {
      "a": "https://github.com/davidicus/react-app-starter.git",
      "b": "https://github.com/davidicus/build-ignore-test.git",
      "z": "https://github.com/davidicus/build-ignore-test.git"
    },
    "github": {
      "token": "yourToken",
      "username": "yourUserName"
    }
  }

```
